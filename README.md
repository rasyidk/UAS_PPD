# Chronic Kidney Disease Detection

This project is a final assignment (UAS) Praktikum Penamabangan Data for detecting **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using machine learning. It features a **web application built with Streamlit**, powered by a **Random Forest model** with **98% accuracy**, trained on a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease).

## üîç Project Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function. Early detection is crucial. This project aims to help identify CKD using clinical parameters and machine learning.

### Features
- ‚úÖ Input form for key medical parameters
- ‚úÖ Real-time prediction (CKD or not CKD)
- ‚úÖ Model built with Random Forest algorithm
- ‚úÖ Model deployment with Streamlit
- ‚úÖ Model serialized with `pickle`
- ‚úÖ Achieved 98% accuracy on test data

## üß† Machine Learning

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 98%
- **Model Serialization**: `pickle`
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
